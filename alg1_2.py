# A deep-learning classifier for decision making.
# All CNCs will be classified into 2 status: be served next or not.
# The parameters for the classifier can be:
# 1. The working status of the CNC. (How much time left for processing)
# 2. The position of the RGV.
# 3. The load time for this CNC.
# 4. Will this CNC complete the final product.
# The return will be a whole sequence of the work line.
